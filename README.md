# Movietoascii
Simple form application that transforms a movie into ascii.

How to: Insert a video called "movie.mp4" in the debug directory (next to the .exe).
Click step 1 (this loads the video into the Frames folder, and only needs to be done once)
Click step 2, which will transform the frames into ascii, and makes a low quality preview video. 

Known issues:
- No file picker for step 1
- Application hang on step 2 (fixed, work in progess)
